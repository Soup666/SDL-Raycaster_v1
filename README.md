# SDL Raycaster

This is the code from my YouTube video! 
I still recommend watching the video so you follow along and see what each part does and how it works but here is the code if you need help. Thank you for the support, postive feedback, and comments! 
Note: Keep the window size the same as it opens to look correct.

## About this Fork

Hey! This is a SDL c++ fork of 3DSage's raycaster. I'm currently learning SDL with c++ and found a lot of useful projects to learn raycasting car and few between. Hopefully someone stumbles accross this and finds it useful. I know I did.

The code has been spaced out a little so it's easier to read. Some constants like `WINDOW_WIDTH` and `WINDOW_HEIGHT` have also been added. 

I've also added a `CMakefile` so you can compile it with `cmake .` and run it with `./build/sdlraycaster`. You'll need to install SDL2 first. 

This was tested on an Intel Mac so if you have any issues on Windows or Linux feel free to pull request.
